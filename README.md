# YT-control
Listening to music on YouTube and want to pause or play the video using the play pause buttons on the keyboard, while being on another application? This python script does exactly that. You can run this on terminal with the sudo command (since one of the libraries needs admin permission). Once you run the script, you can quit terminal and the play pause key will be mapped to youtube until you use it for something else (Spotify).
