# YT-control
Listening to music on YouTube and want to pause or play the video using the play pause buttons on the keyboard, while being on another application? This python script does exactly that. You can run this on terminal with the sudo command (since one of the libraries needs admin permission). To make it work, hold fn when pressing the play pause key (so it works with f8), althought this can be easily changed.
